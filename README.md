# Android Calculator App
Android clone of the Mac OS Calculator created while following the course:
[The Complete Android Kotlin Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaoBUAdcl9XRw==/)

The App supports a couple of screen densities and two orientation specific layouts. Other than that the
application behaves as expected though improvements could be made.

## Modifications
The app logic has been rewritten from what is presented in the course using my personal criteria and experience while
refactoring the code.
